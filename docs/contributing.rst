Collaborating
=============

The success of a file format is only determined by the extent of its adoption.
For this reason we greatly welcome any feedback and contribution from
interested users.

The Photon-HDF5 project consist of these parts:

1. `Reference Documentation <http://photon-hdf5.readthedocs.org/>`__ (i.e. this document).
2. `Examples on reading Photon-HDF5 in multiple languages <https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/photon_hdf5_reading_examples>`__.
3. `phconvert <http://photon-hdf5.github.io/phconvert/>`__: reference python library for writing and converting
   Photon-HDF5 files.

All the sources (including for the documentation) are `hosted on GitHub <https://github.com/Photon-HDF5>`__
and we encourage to open *GitHub Issues* in the
`documentation repository <https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/photon-hdf5>`__
to discuss any topic related Photon-HDF5.
You can also contact us by email, but we prefer to use GitHub in order to
keep any discussion public.

Contributions (such as fixes or enhancements) can be sent using *GitHub Pull Requests*
(PR). You can find guides on how to send a PR on the GitHub website. If have have any
